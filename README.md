# Project Summary

## Tools

The analysis of this dataset was performed using SQL. For that reason, the following tools were used:
1. **Microsoft SQL Server**
2. **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**

In this project, I used my SQL skills to perform EDA and other types of analyses on the dataset containing reviews for Apple Store apps found on the Kaggle platform.
The used dataset is large attribute-wise, and hence I didn't use all of them, but only the ones that I found helpful in analyzing, such as:

**App ID** 

**App Name** 

**App Genre** 

**Average Ratings** 

**Number of Ratings**

**Price**

**Number of Languages**

**App Description**

## Analysis Goal:
Assist app developer decide what type of app he should make.

To make our analysis more efficient, we need to break down our problem into smaller analysis topics.

### Topics
1. **Analysis of genre popularity (number of reviews)**
  - What are the most popular genres of apps?
  - What are the least popular genres of apps?
  - Calculate the average rating for both groups.
  - Gain insight into which content group has, on average, the best reviews.
2. **Analysis of app prices**
  - Are paid or free apps better rated?
  - Calculating average ratings for each pricing category (I've divided apps into price categories, the length of the interval being 50$).
3. **Other analyses**
  - Analysis of average app rating for each number of language groups (I've divided apps into language categories, the length of the interval being 15 languages).
  - Analysis of the correlation between rating and app description length.
